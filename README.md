Face detection in Python using OpenCV and the Haar cascade approach

It takes a file as the first argument and can be run by doing the following inside the project's folder:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py path/to/video/file.ext
```

> The use of a virtual environment is recommended to avoid dependency conflicts with other projects.

This project was built using Python 3.13.2, but I believe it should work with any 3.x version.
